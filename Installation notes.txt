Jupyter Lab installation Notes

Need both Python and Visual C studio (C++ Build Tools) before installing.  
The installation process is done in the command prompt. 
Quick note: cd - change directory, is how you navigate between directories (ie. folders as seen in File Explorer)  

Once Python is downloaded and installed, there will be a folder with all of the python related code somewhere on your computer. 
For me, it's location is C:\Users\elima\AppData\Local\Programs\Python

To install JupyterLab, you need for the command prompt to be in the scripts directory.
For me:
cd C:\Users\elima\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Scripts

Then, I could follow the installation guide for pip
https://jupyter.org/install  

pip install jupyterlab 

also

pip install ipywidgets
